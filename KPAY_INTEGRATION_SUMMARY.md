## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Testing
1. **Database migration must be completed successfully**
2. **Actual KPay credentials are required** (placeholder values won't work)
3. **Server must be able to reach KPay API endpoints**
4. **Webhook endpoint must be accessible from KPay servers**

### Production Considerations
1. **HTTPS is required** for webhook endpoints in production
2. **IP whitelisting** must be configured with KPay
3. **Monitor payment success rates** and error rates
4. **Set up payment reconciliation** processes

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Start with Cash on Delivery** to verify basic functionality
2. **Test each KPay method individually** in sandbox
3. **Verify webhook processing** with test payments
4. **Test error scenarios** and recovery flows
