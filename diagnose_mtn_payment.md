# MTN Mobile Money Payment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Not Receiving SMS for Payment Confirmation

Based on your logs, the payment is being processed correctly by KPay (`statusid: '02'`) but you're not receiving the SMS from MTN.

## Fixed Issues ‚úÖ

1. **Status Mapping**: Fixed the incorrect mapping where `statusid: '02'` was being treated as "failed" when it actually means "processing/pending SMS confirmation"
2. **079 Prefix Support**: Added support for MTN 079 numbers in validation
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track what data is sent to KPay

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. MTN Mobile Money Account Issues
**Check:**
- Is your 079 number registered for MTN Mobile Money?
- Is your Mobile Money account active and has sufficient balance for any fees?
- Have you used Mobile Money recently?

**Solution:** 
- Dial `*182#` to check your Mobile Money status
- Try a small Mobile Money transaction to verify it's working

### 2. Network/SMS Delays
**Check:**
- MTN network coverage in your area
- General SMS delivery working on your phone
- Try waiting 5-10 minutes for delayed SMS

**Solution:**
- Try the payment from a different location with better network coverage
- Check if you have SMS blocking enabled

### 3. KPay Integration Delays
**Check:**
- Your logs show `momtransactionid: '1760125532'` which means MTN processed it
- The payment status is stuck in processing (`statusid: '02'`)

**Solution:**
- Wait longer (up to 15-30 minutes) as some mobile money transactions can be slow
- Try with a different MTN number (078, 077, 076) to see if it's specific to 079

### 4. Phone Settings Issues
**Check:**
- Do Not Disturb mode disabled
- SMS notifications enabled
- No SMS filtering/blocking active
- Try restarting your phone

### 5. Amount/Transaction Limits
**Check:**
- Your transaction amount: 46,000 RWF
- Daily/monthly Mobile Money limits
- First-time transaction limits

**Solution:**
- Try with a smaller amount (e.g., 1,000 RWF) to test
- Check your Mobile Money limits with `*182#`

## Immediate Testing Steps

### Step 1: Try Alternative MTN Number
If you have access to another MTN number (078, 077, 076), test with that first:

1. Use your existing 078/077/076 MTN number
2. Make a small test payment (1,000 RWF)
3. See if SMS arrives promptly

### Step 2: Check MTN Mobile Money Status
```
Dial: *182#
Check: Account status, balance, recent transactions
```

### Step 3: Test Small Amount
1. Try payment with 1,000 RWF instead of 46,000 RWF
2. Some carriers have limits on first-time transactions

### Step 4: Monitor Enhanced Logs
With the new logging in place, try another payment and check:

```bash
# In your Next.js development console, look for:
üîç KPay payment request details: {
  msisdn: "0791234567",
  bankid: "63510", 
  pmethod: "momo",
  amount: 1000,
  ...
}
```

### Step 5: Wait and Retry
1. Sometimes MTN Mobile Money SMS can be delayed up to 30 minutes
2. Try the same payment reference again after waiting
3. Check if the payment eventually completes

## What The Logs Tell Us

‚úÖ **Working Correctly:**
- Phone number formatting: `079XXXXXXX` ‚úì
- KPay API communication: Transaction ID received ‚úì  
- Payment initiation: `retcode: 0` (success) ‚úì
- MTN processing: `momtransactionid` present ‚úì

‚ùì **Unknown/Pending:**
- MTN SMS delivery to your specific 079 number
- Whether your 079 number is registered for Mobile Money
- Network/carrier delays

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If SMS Arrives Eventually:
- This is normal - some Mobile Money transactions are slow
- No action needed, system is working correctly

### If SMS Never Arrives:
1. **Try different MTN number** (078/077/076)
2. **Check Mobile Money registration** (`*182#`)  
3. **Contact MTN support** about SMS delivery to 079 numbers
4. **Try smaller test amount** first

### If Alternative MTN Numbers Work:
- Issue is specific to 079 prefix with MTN Mobile Money
- Contact MTN support about 079 number compatibility
- Use alternative MTN number temporarily

### If No MTN Numbers Work:
- Check KPay sandbox vs. production environment settings
- Verify KPay credentials and IP whitelisting
- Contact KPay support
